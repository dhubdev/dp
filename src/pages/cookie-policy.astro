				As is common practice with almost all professional websites, this site
				uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer,
				to improve your experience. This page describes what information they
				gather, how we use it, and why we sometimes need to store these cookies.
				We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored,
				however, this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the site's
				functionality.
			</p><h3 class="sc-8b0fa437-3 bPicwe">How We Use Cookies</h3><p
				class="sc-8b0fa437-4 gBiTlp"
			>
				We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately,
				in most cases, there are no industry standard options for disabling
				cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they
				add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you
				are not sure whether you need them or not, in case they are used to
				provide a service that you use.
			</p><h3 class="sc-8b0fa437-3 bPicwe">Disabling Cookies</h3><p
				class="sc-8b0fa437-4 gBiTlp"
			>
				You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your
				browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be aware that
				disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other
				websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also
				disabling certain functionality and features of this site. Therefore, it
				is recommended that you do not disable cookies.
			</p><h3 class="sc-8b0fa437-3 bPicwe">The Cookies We Set</h3><p

				Hopefully, that has clarified things for you, and as was previously
				mentioned, if there is something that you aren't sure whether you need
				or not, it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does
				interact with one of the features you use on our site.
